For example, a rocket's velocity is a 3-dimensional vector: its magnitude is the speed of the rocket, and its direction is (hopefully) up. A vector can be represented by an array of numbers called *scalars*. Each scalar corresponds to the magnitude of the vector with regards to each dimension.\n\nFor example, say the rocket is going up at a slight angle: it has a vertical speed of 5,000 m/s, and also a slight speed towards the East at 10 m/s, and a slight speed towards the North at 50 m/s. The rocket's velocity may be represented by the following vector:\n\n**velocity** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n50 \\\\\n5000 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNote: by convention vectors are generally presented in the form of columns. Also, vector names are usually lowercase to distinguish them from matrices (which we will discuss below) and in bold (when possible) to distinguish them from simple scalar values such as ${meters\\_per\\_second} = 5026$.\n\nA list of N numbers may also represent the coordinates of a point in an N-dimensional space, so it is quite frequent to represent vectors as simple points instead of arrows. A vector with 1 element may be represented as an arrow or a point on an axis, a vector with 2 elements is an arrow or a point on a plane, a vector with 3 elements is an arrow or a point in space, and a vector with N elements is an arrow or a point in an N-dimensional spaceâ€¦ which most people find hard to imagine.\n\n\n##  Purpose\nVectors have many purposes in Machine Learning, most notably to represent observations and predictions. For example, say we built a Machine Learning system to classify videos into 3 categories (good, spam, clickbait) based on what we know about them. For each video, we would have a vector representing what we know about it, such as:\n\n**video** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n10.5 \\\\\n5.2 \\\\\n3.25 \\\\\n7.0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis vector could represent a video that lasts 10.5 minutes, but only 5.2% viewers watch for more than a minute, it gets 3.25 views per day on average, and it was flagged 7 times as spam. As you can see, each axis may have a different meaning.\n\nBased on this vector our Machine Learning system may predict that there is an 80% probability that it is a spam video, 18% that it is clickbait, and 2% that it is a good video. This could be represented as the following vector:\n\n**class_probabilities** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.80 \\\\\n0.18 \\\\\n0.02\n\\end{pmatrix}$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Vectors in python\nIn python, a vector can be represented in many ways, the simplest being a regular python list of numbers:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"[10.5, 5.2, 3.25, 7.0]","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since we plan to do quite a lot of scientific calculations, it is much better to use NumPy's `ndarray`, which provides a lot of convenient and optimized implementations of essential mathematical operations on vectors (for more details about NumPy, check out the [NumPy tutorial](tools_numpy.ipynb)).

A vertical vector ends up tilted to the right, so vertical vectors are *NOT* eigenvectors of $M$.\n\nIf we look at the squeeze mapping, we find that any horizontal or vertical vector keeps its direction (although its length changes), so all horizontal and vertical vectors are eigenvectors of $F_{squeeze}$.\n\nHowever, rotation matrices have no eigenvectors at all (except if the rotation angle is 0Â° or 180Â°, in which case all non-zero vectors are eigenvectors).\n\nNumPy's `eig` function returns the list of unit eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues for any square matrix.
